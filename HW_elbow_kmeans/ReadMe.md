## README.md: K-Means Clustering and Elbow Method

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement **K-Means Clustering** on a synthetic dataset using the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters (\( k \)). We use Python libraries like `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and `yellowbrick` to perform clustering, evaluate model accuracy, and visualize the results.

### Dataset
The dataset is generated using `make_blobs()` from scikit-learn. This function generates a synthetic dataset with predefined clusters. In this example, we created 300 data points, randomly assigned to 4 clusters with some noise.

### Key Steps in the Project:

1. **Generating the Data**:
   - We generate a synthetic dataset using `make_blobs()` from scikit-learn with 4 centers (clusters).

2. **Elbow Method for Optimal \( k \)**:
   - We apply the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters. The idea behind the Elbow Method is to plot the **inertia (within-cluster sum of squares)** for different values of \( k \) and identify the point where adding more clusters no longer significantly improves the model (this is called the "elbow" point).
   - We found that \( k = 4 \) is the optimal value based on the Elbow plot. At this point, the inertia starts decreasing more slowly, indicating that adding more clusters wonâ€™t significantly improve the clustering.

3. **Clustering with K-Means**:
   - After identifying \( k = 4 \), we use the K-Means algorithm to cluster the dataset.
   
4. **Accuracy Calculation**:
   - We relabel the predicted clusters to match the true labels and calculate the accuracy of the clustering model.

5. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - A confusion matrix is plotted to visually compare the true labels with the predicted labels, providing insights into how well the clustering worked.

6. **KElbowVisualizer**:
   - We use `yellowbrick`'s **KElbowVisualizer** to automatically determine the best \( k \) value and validate our manual process.

### Requirements

You will need the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install matplotlib scikit-learn scipy yellowbrick
```

### Code Explanation

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from scipy.stats import mode
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay

# Step 1: Generate synthetic dataset
X, y_true = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.60, random_state=0)

# Step 2: Apply K-Means with varying k and calculate WCSS (Inertia)
wcss = []
k_range = range(1, 11)  # Trying k values from 1 to 10
for k in k_range:
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)

# Step 3: Plot the Elbow Method graph (Inertia vs k)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(k_range, wcss, marker='o')
plt.title('Elbow Method for Optimal k')
plt.xlabel('Number of clusters (k)')
plt.ylabel('Inertia (WCSS)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Step 4: Choose the best k (from the Elbow, let's say k = 4)
best_k = 4
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=best_k, random_state=42)
y_kmeans = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Step 5: Relabel the clusters to match the true labels using mode
labels = np.zeros_like(y_kmeans)
for i in range(best_k):
    mask = (y_kmeans == i)
    labels[mask] = mode(y_true[mask])[0]

# Step 6: Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, labels)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Step 7: Create and plot the confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, labels)
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm)
disp.plot(cmap=plt.cm.Blues)
plt.title('Confusion Matrix for K-Means Clustering')
plt.show()
```

### Using KElbowVisualizer
We also use `yellowbrick`'s **KElbowVisualizer** to simplify the process of determining the optimal \( k \).

```python
from yellowbrick.cluster import KElbowVisualizer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# Generate synthetic dataset
X, y_true = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.60, random_state=0)

# Create a KMeans model
kmeans = KMeans(random_state=42)

# Use KElbowVisualizer to find the optimal k
visualizer = KElbowVisualizer(kmeans, k=(1, 11))

# Fit the visualizer to the data and display the plot
visualizer.fit(X)
visualizer.show()
```

### Explanation of Elbow Method Results
Based on the Elbow plot, we identified that the optimal \( k \) value is **4**. This is the point where the **inertia** (within-cluster sum of squares) starts to decrease at a slower rate, indicating that adding more clusters would not significantly improve the clustering. Hence, \( k = 4 \) provides a good balance between model complexity and clustering performance.

### Conclusion

In this project, we demonstrated how to use the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means clustering. We used a synthetic dataset with known clusters, calculated accuracy, and visualized the clustering results using a confusion matrix. Additionally, we utilized `yellowbrick`'s **KElbowVisualizer** to automate the process of finding the best \( k \). 

This project is a solid starting point for applying K-Means clustering to more complex, real-world datasets.
